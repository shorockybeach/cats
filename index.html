  <h2> Why don't people realize cats can dance? </h2>
    <p> Cats are known to be pretty shy, and they don't want to show off their true potential to human-beings. </p> <!-- Here this is how you make a hidden comment-->
  
   <ul>
      <li> They are shy </li>
      <li> They are sensitive </li>
      <li> Not everyone deserves great cats </li>
   </ul>
    
  <h1> How About Dogs? </h1> <!-- Another random comment here-->
    <p> Unfortunately, people are dumb and they assume dogs are smarter than cats just because dogs do whatever they are told to do. </p>

      <li> Dogs drool </li>
      <li> Dog fur is very rough and doesn't feel good </li>
    </ul>
